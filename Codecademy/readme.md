Some might say Poetry is having a moment right now. due to the [Internet culture](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/booknews/4863351/Internet-is-causing-poetry-boom.html). 
However, poetry has been always having a moment, as we can see [as early as 1952](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/4967408/Worlds-first-computer-was-used-to-generate-love-poetry.html), people were using computers to write love poems.
